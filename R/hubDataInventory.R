#' @title Dataset inventory of the Atlas hub datasets
#' @description Function to provide a quick overview of a climate dataset
#'  (either stations or gridded data) stored in the Atlas hub.
#' @param dataset A character string poiting to the target. Either a directory containing the data
#'  in the case of station data in standard ASCII format (see \code{\link{loadStationData}}) for details),
#'  or a target file (a NcML) in the case of other types of gridded data (reanalysis, gridded observations ...,
#'  see \code{\link{loadGridData}} for details).
#' @param return.stats Optional logical flag indicating if summary statistics of the dataset
#'  should be returned with the inventory. Only used for station data.
#' @return A list of components describing the variables and other characteristics of the target dataset.
#' @note The variable names returned correspond to the original names of the variables as stored in the dataset,
#' and not to the standard naming convention defined in the vocabulary.
#' @export
