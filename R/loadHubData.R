#' @title Load a grid from a dataset stored in the Atlas hub
#' @description Load a user-defined spatio-temporal slice from a dataset which is stored in the Atlas hub.
#' @template templateParams
#' @param members A vector of integers indicating the members to be loaded.
#'  Default to \code{NULL}, which loads all available members if the dataset contains members (i.e. in case a Ensemble Axis is defined).
#'  For instance, \code{members=1:5} will retrieve the first five members of dataset.
#'   Note that unlike \code{\link{loadSeasonalForecast}}, discontinuous member selections (e.g. \code{members=c(1,5,7)}) are NOT allowed. 
#'   If the requested dataset has no Ensemble Axis (or it is a static field, e.g. orography) it will be ignored.
#' @param dictionary Default to FALSE, if TRUE a dictionary is used and the .dic file is stored in the same path than the
#' dataset. If the .dic file is stored elsewhere, then the argument is the full path to the .dic file (including the extension,
#' e.g.: \code{"/path/to/the/dictionary_file.dic"}). This is the case for instance when the dataset is stored in a remote URL,
#' and we have a locally stored dictionary for that particular dataset. If FALSE no variable homogenization takes place,
#' and the raw variable, as originally stored in the dataset, will be returned. See details for dictionary specification.
#' @param time A character vector indicating the temporal filtering/aggregation 
#' of the output data. Default to \code{"none"}, which returns the original time 
#' series as stored in the dataset. For sub-daily variables, instantantaneous data at 
#' selected verification times can be filtered using one of the character strings 
#' \code{"00"}, \code{"03"}, \code{"06"}, \code{"09"}, \code{"12"}, \code{"15"},
#'  \code{"18"}, \code{"21"},and \code{"00"} when applicable. If daily aggregated data are 
#' required use \code{"DD"}. If the requested variable is static (e.g. orography) it will be ignored. 
#' See the next arguments for time aggregation options.
#' @param aggr.d Character string. Function of aggregation of sub-daily data for daily data calculation. 
#' Currently accepted values are \code{"none"}, \code{"mean"}, \code{"min"}, \code{"max"} and \code{"sum"}.
#' @param aggr.m Same as \code{aggr.d}, bun indicating the aggregation function to compute monthly from daily data.
#' If \code{aggr.m = "none"} (the default), no monthly aggregation is undertaken.
#' @param threshold Optional, only needed if absolute/relative frequencies are required. A float number defining the threshold
#'  used by  \code{condition} (the next argument).
#' @param condition Optional, only needed if absolute/relative frequencies are required. Inequality operator to be applied considering the given threshold.
#'  \code{"GT"} = greater than the value of \code{threshold}, \code{"GE"} = greater or equal,
#'   \code{"LT"} = lower than, \code{"LE"} = lower or equal than
#' @template templateReturnGridData
#' @template templateDicDetails  
#' @template templateTimeAggr
#' @template templateGeolocation
#' @note The function assumes that you are working from the Atlas hub and the user has read permissions to the shared directory.
#' To load data not stored in the Atlas hub, the user should rely on \code{\link[loadeR]{loadGridData}}
